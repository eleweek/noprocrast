noprocrast
==========

A simple web app to reduce procrastination.

At this point it is more of a prototype rather than full app, e.g. it doesn't support https and stuff

1. Put your favourite picture as pic.jpg
2. Run it as ```python app.py 80```
3. Then add


```127.0.0.1   yourfavouritewebsite.com```

For example

```
127.0.0.1   reddit.com
127.0.0.1   www.reddit.com
127.0.0.1   facebook.com
127.0.0.1   www.facebook.com
```
